    This can also be JSON I believe, and this may even be covered by ../.vscode/launch.json and settings.json
    Goals for this file's contents:
    
    -Establish a standard password "Monday01" as default
    -Establish the URLs and ports that are used in this project
    -Geoserver instance information
    -Anything else that needs to be standardized project-wide

    How to consume/reference this from another file is probably the next step, after this file is syntactically correct.
